This script will install ceph on 1 node(physical or VM).
Script is tested on CentOS 7. Do not use if there are old (half)working ceph installation, reinstall OS first. Server must have 2 H(V)DDs - one for the operating system and one for ceph storage. Before running the script sure second block device is cleared - no existing partitions or LVM sigantures. If script complains hdd is not empty use wipefs to clear it and run it again.
