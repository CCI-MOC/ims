      -> Checking that bmi-test-image exists in Ceph...

      -> Checking that bmi-test-image exists in Ceph...

    When BMI will import an image                          # tests/bdd/steps/bmi_import.py:7
      | image_name     | project_name |

      -> Checking that 2img3 exists in BMI's database...
         Running: rbd ls | grep 2img3

      -> Checking that 2img3 is removed from Ceph...
         Running: rbd ls | grep 2img3
    Then RBD will confirm the removed image's clone        # tests/bdd/steps/rbd_rm.py:4

  Starting the Acceptance Tests...
--------------------------------------------------

Feature: Running a round of create/import/remove between Ceph and BMI # tests/bdd/features/moc-0.5-release/end-to-end-acceptance-test.feature:1

  Scenario: Importing/Removing Image, DB/Ceph consistency  # tests/bdd/features/moc-0.5-release/end-to-end-acceptance-test.feature:3
    Given RBD will create an image                         # tests/bdd/steps/rbd_create.py:8
      | image_name     |
      | bmi-test-image |
      -> Checking that no pre-existing bmi-test-image is present in Ceph, before creating it...
         Running: rbd ls | grep bmi-test-image
      -> Creating the bmi-test-image image in Ceph...
         Running: rbd create bmi-test-image --size 1 --image-format 2
      -> Checking that bmi-test-image exists in Ceph...
         Running: rbd ls | grep bmi-test-image
    When BMI will import an image                          # tests/bdd/steps/bmi_import.py:7
      | image_name     | project_name |
      | bmi-test-image | bmi_dev      |
         Running: bmi import bmi_dev bmi-test-image
      -> Checking that bmi-test-image exists in Ceph...
         Running: bmi db ls | grep bmi-test-image
      -> Checking that 2img3 exists in BMI's database...
         Running: rbd ls | grep 2img3
    And BMI will remove an image                           # tests/bdd/steps/bmi_rm.py:4
      | image_name     | project_name |
      | bmi-test-image | bmi_dev      |
         Running: bmi rm bmi_dev bmi-test-image
      -> Checking that 2img3 is removed from BMI's database...
         Running: bmi db ls | grep 2img3
      -> Checking that 2img3 is removed from Ceph...
         Running: rbd ls | grep 2img3
    Then RBD will confirm the removed image's clone        # tests/bdd/steps/rbd_rm.py:4
      | image_name     | project_name |
      | bmi-test-image | bmi_dev      |
      -> Checking that 2img3 is removed from Ceph...
         Running: rbd ls | grep 2img3
    And RBD will remove the created image                  # tests/bdd/steps/rbd_rm.py:23
      | image_name     |
      | bmi-test-image |
         Running: rbd rm bmi-test-image
      -> Checking that bmi-test-image is removed from Ceph...
         Running: rbd ls | grep image_name
